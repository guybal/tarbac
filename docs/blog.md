# üöÄ TARBAC: IT Breaks-the-Glass for Self-Service Dynamic Access

In the fast-paced world of Kubernetes, static Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) systems often fall short. Traditional RBAC models are rigid, requiring manual intervention for role assignments and cleanups, which can lead to security risks and operational inefficiencies. Enter Tarbac, a cloud native solution designed to address these challenges by introducing time-based and self-service, policy-driven access controls.

**Temporal Adaptive Role Based Access Controller (TARBAC)** provides a Kubernetes-native solution to manage temporary RBAC permissions dynamically. It ensures secure, time-limited access by leveraging a self-service, policy-driven approach. Developers request what they need, policies validate the request, and temporary access is granted (and revoked) automatically.

## üîç The Problems

### 1. Static Permissions in a Dynamic World

Traditional RBAC systems are static, meaning roles are created once and persist indefinitely unless manually revoked. This approach is ill-suited for dynamic Kubernetes environments where access needs can change rapidly. Static permissions can lead to over-privileged users and potential security vulnerabilities.

**Tarbac Solution**: Time-bound roles bindings. Tarbac introduces roles that automatically expire after a specified duration. This ensures that access is granted just in time, for just the right amount of time, and disappears automatically, eliminating the risk of lingering permissions.

### ‚è≥ The IT Bottleneck

In traditional RBAC systems, IT teams are the gatekeepers of access control. This often results in delays and inefficiencies, especially during critical situations like production outages. Developers need to wait for IT approval to gain the necessary access, which can hinder productivity and slow down incident resolution.

**Tarbac Solution**: Self-service, policy-driven access. Tarbac empowers developers to request access through a self-service model. Policies validate the requests, and access is granted automatically if the request aligns with the predefined policies. This reduces the dependency on IT and accelerates the access provisioning process.

## üõ†Ô∏è How Tarbac Works: Key Components

Tarbac leverages six Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to manage access control dynamically:

- **`SudoAccess`**: Temporary, namespace-scoped access.
- **`SudoPolicy`**: namespace-scoped policy that validate who can do what, where, and for how long.
- **`ClusterSudoAccess`**: Break-glass access for cluster-wide emergencies.
- **`ClusterSudoPolicy`**: Policies governing cluster-level requests.
- **`TemporaryRBAC`**: Temporary `RoleBindings` for namespace-scoped access.
- **`ClusterTemporaryRBAC`**: Temporary `ClusterRoleBindings` for cluster-scoped access.

## üîÑ The Tarbac Workflow

1. **Request Access**: A user submits a SudoAccess or ClusterSudoAccess request, specifying the role, resources, and a time-to-live (TTL).
2. **Policy Validation**: Tarbac evaluates the request against `SudoPolicy` or `ClusterSudoPolicy`. If the request aligns with the policy, access is granted.
3. **Temporary RoleBindings**: Tarbac creates the necessary `RoleBindings` or `ClusterRoleBindings` and starts the timer.
4. **Automatic Cleanup**: When the TTL expires, the permissions are automatically revoked, ensuring no lingering access.

## üåê Real-World Use Cases

### üêõ Use Case 1: Debugging a Broken Pod in QA

In this scenario, Alice, a QA engineer, needs 30 minutes of edit access in the QA namespace to debug a broken pod.

First, the IT or Security team must define the following `SudoPolicy` beforehand:

```yaml
apiVersion: tarbac.io/v1
kind: SudoPolicy
metadata:
    name: qa-edit-policy
    namespace: qa
spec:
    maxDuration: 1h
    roleRef:
        apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
        kind: Role
        name: edit
    allowedUsers:
        - name: alice
```

- **`maxDuration`**: Maximum access duration (e.g., 1 hour).
- **`roleRef`**: References the `Role` to grant (`edit` in this case).
- **`allowedUsers`**: Specifies who can request access.
- **`allowedNamespaces`**: Limits the policy to the `qa` namespace.

Next, Alice submits a `SudoAccess` request in the desired `qa` namespace:

```yaml
apiVersion: tarbac.io/v1
kind: SudoAccess
metadata:
    name: debug-qa-pod
    namespace: qa
spec:
    duration: 30m
    policy: qa-edit-policy
```

- **`duration`**: The duration for which permissions are required (e.g., 30 minutes).
- **`policy`**: The name of the `SudoPolicy` governing the request.

Once approved, Alice gets the access she needs. After 30 minutes, the access is automatically revoked, ensuring no lingering permissions.

### üö® Use Case 2: Cluster-Wide Emergency

During a cluster-wide emergency, the lead engineer needs 15 minutes of cluster-admin access.

First, the IT or Security team must define the following `ClusterSudoPolicy` beforehand:

```yaml
apiVersion: tarbac.io/v1
kind: ClusterSudoPolicy
metadata:
    name: emergency-cluster-admin-policy
spec:
    maxDuration: 1h
    roleRef:
        apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
        kind: ClusterRole
        name: cluster-admin
    allowedUsers:
        - name: lead-engineer
    allowedNamespaces:
        - '*'
```

- **`maxDuration`**: Maximum access duration (e.g., 1 hour).
- **`roleRef`**: References the `ClusterRole` to grant (`cluster-admin` in this case).
- **`allowedUsers`**: Specifies who can request access.
- **`allowedNamespaces`**: Allows access to all namespaces.

The lead engineer then submits a `ClusterSudoAccess` request:

```yaml
apiVersion: tarbac.io/v1
kind: ClusterSudoRequest
metadata:
    name: emergency-cluster-admin
spec:
    duration: 15m
    policy: emergency-cluster-admin-policy
```

- **`duration`**: The duration for which permissions are required (e.g., 15 minutes).
- **`policy`**: The name of the `ClusterSudoPolicy` governing the request.

The request is validated against the policy, and access is granted. After 15 minutes, the access is automatically revoked, ensuring security and compliance.

### üåü Use Case 3: Dynamic Attribute-Based Provisioning

Imagine a development team is having a failure across few services deployed on different namespaces.
Team A's tech lead needs administrative access to all namespaces labeled with `team: a` for an hour.

First, the IT or Security team must define the following `ClusterSudoPolicy` beforehand:

```yaml
apiVersion: tarbac.io/v1
kind: ClusterSudoPolicy
metadata:
    name: team-a-namespaces-admin
spec:
    maxDuration: 4h
    roleRef:
        apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
        kind: ClusterRole
        name: cluster-admin
    allowedUsers:
        - name: tech-lead
    allowedNamespacesSelector:
        matchLabels:
            team: a
```

- **`maxDuration`**: Maximum access duration (e.g., 4 hours).
- **`roleRef`**: References the `ClusterRole` to grant (`cluster-admin` in this case).
- **`allowedUsers`**: Specifies who can request access.
- **`allowedNamespacesSelector`**: Limits the policy to namespaces labeled with `team: a`.

The tech lead then submits a `ClusterSudoRequest`:

```yaml
apiVersion: tarbac.io/v1
kind: ClusterSudoRequest
metadata:
    name: break-the-glass
spec:
    duration: 1h
    policy: team-a-namespaces-admin
```

- **`duration`**: The duration for which permissions are required (e.g., 1 hour).
- **`policy`**: The name of the `ClusterSudoPolicy` governing the request.

This policy ensures that the tech lead can only request access to namespaces that are dynamically selected based on the label `team: a`. After the specified duration of 1 hour, the access is automatically revoked, maintaining security and compliance.

#### üìä Monitoring and Auditing

Tarbac provides comprehensive monitoring and auditing capabilities to ensure transparency and accountability. Administrators can track access requests, approvals, and revocations through detailed logs and events. This helps in maintaining a clear audit trail and enhances security by allowing for regular reviews and audits of access activities.

##### üìÖ Events

All relevant `Events` are transparently rendered to the cluster, tagged with the corresponding `RequestID`. This ensures a clear audit trail of access requests, approvals, and revocations, providing administrators with detailed insights into who performed what actions, when, and under which policies.

```bash
kubectl get events -n default

LAST SEEN   TYPE     REASON      OBJECT                                             MESSAGE
